This repo contains two main high level folders:
(1) client -- this contains all materials to run the frontend and backend (click on the folder for more details)
(2) data --- this contains all the data science and statistical modeling, as well as the API calls and endpoints involved in the project
  - In order to run this program locally, you have to run "run.R" after installing R on your system. You also need a free Google Maps API key for Places and Geocoding, which you can save to your .env file and call it accordingly.

AI use: Claude Sonnet 3.5 and ChatGPT 5.1 for refactoring code and minor frontend stylistic changes, all ideas and foundational code were written by either Daren or Max.
